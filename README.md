# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
In this repository, I present my Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) graduation project, aiming to build an efficient real-time system that accurately identifies emotions from speech signals. With applications in human-computer interaction, it offers diverse datasets, multiple DL models, and comprehensive documentation for easy understanding the system.
# Demo
